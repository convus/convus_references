# Topics

The topics for convus.org are in [topics.csv](topics/topics.csv)

A couple of things:

- Prefer singular names for topics over plurals
- The "Parents" column is comma delineated
- Parent topics should only be _direct_ parents - e.g. for Chicago, the parents cell has "Illinois" - and doesn't have "U.S. State"
